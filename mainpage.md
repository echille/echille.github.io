### About Me

I am a Master's student at the University of Rhode Island studying the embryogenesis of the Pacific rice coral, *Montipora capitata*, and the effects of ocean acidification on its embryonic development on a molecular level. I am skilled in science communication, DNA/RNA extractions, scientific diving, microscopy, bioinformatics, and coral aquaculture. In my free time, I enjoy partner-dancing, exploring the great outdoors, and watching sit-coms (especially *The Office*).

I will be graduating with a M.S. in Evolutionary and Marine Biology in May 2021, and am planning on entering into a Ph.D. program in the Fall of 2021. My research interests are primarily focused on investigating the mechanisms that allow reef-building corals to adapt and acclimatize to multiple simultaneous stressors, and the implications of these mechanisms towards conservation and ecology.
