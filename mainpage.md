### About Me

<img style="float: left;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/echille/echille.github.io/master/img/IMG-2540.png">

I am a a master's student studying **Marine and Evolutionary Biology** in the [Putnam Lab](http://putnamlab.com/) at the University of Rhode Island.My research interests are primarily focused on investigating the mechanisms that allow hermatypic corals to adapt and acclimatize to multiple simultaneous stressors, and the implications of these mechanisms towards conservation and ecology. Currently, I am studying the physiological and transcriptomic effects of projected oceanic pH levels on the rice coral, *Montipora capitata*, throughout its embryogenesis.

If you would like to find more information about my research, or other Putnam Lab projects, please visit the Putnam Lab.
