As a young girl growing up in South County, Rhode Island, I loved to explore. During the summers I would run off into the Garrison Acre woods to hunt for turtles, don my mask and snorkel to watch the horseshoe crabs in Narrow River, and clamber among the tide pools near Whale Rock. My frequent pursuits to discover “new life and new civilizations” kindled my bond with the ocean. I still feel most at home when I hear the pounding of waves against the shore. 

As I grew older, I became cognizant of human impacts in the places I loved to explore. This led me to volunteer at Mystic Aquarium, and later on at Biomes Marine Biology Center. In these hubs of aquatic information, I was able to introduce visitors to local and exotic marine life through feeding demonstrations, touch tanks, speeches, and one-on-one dialogue. I felt that by sharing with others my knowledge of, and wonder for the marine world that they might become more conscious of their environmental footprint. I continued this work through my Girl Scout Gold Award project: “Something Fishy at the Market.” Working closely with the director of Biomes Marine Biology Center, I developed a curriculum for home-schooled students to learn about sustainable seafood. In addition to this curriculum, I also created a [blog](https://erinburr124.wixsite.com/something-fishy) that covered topics such as bioaccumulation, mercury poisoning, and apps to help people identify sustainable seafood.

In 2017, I joined the Narrow River Preservation Association as a board member. In addition to helping plan and execute fundraising and outreach events, I also participate as a river monitor for the River Watch program, coordinate the NRPA Bi-annual River Clean Up, and am leading an effort to make the River Watch data and analyses publicly available.
