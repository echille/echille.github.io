### Activism

In 2017, I joined the Narrow River Preservation Association as a board member. In addition to helping plan and execute fundraising and outreach events, I also participate as a river monitor for the River Watch program, coordinate the NRPA Bi-annual River Clean Up, and am leading an effort to make the River Watch data and analyses publicly available.

### Visual Storytelling

In Spring of 2019 I became a certified diver in underwater photography, specializing in videography. Sharing the alien underwater world through video has become one of my passions. See some of my projects below:

### Outreach  
#### Volunteering at Mystic Aquarium and Biomes Marine Biology Center:  
In these hubs of aquatic information, I was able to introduce visitors to local and exotic marine life through feeding demonstrations, touch tanks, short speeches, and one-on-one dialogue. I felt that by sharing with others my knowledge of, and wonder for the marine world that they might become more conscious of their environmental footprint.  
#### “Something Fishy at the Market”:  
For my Girl Scout Gold Award project, “Something Fishy at the Market," I worked closely with the director of Biomes Marine Biology Center, to develop a curriculum for home-schooled students to learn about sustainable seafood. In addition to this curriculum, I also created a [blog](https://erinburr124.wixsite.com/something-fishy) that covered topics such as bioaccumulation, mercury poisoning, and apps to help people identify sustainable seafood.
